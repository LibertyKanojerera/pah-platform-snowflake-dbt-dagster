# Session Log

One entry per session. The `Next:` line is written before closing the laptop,
never at the start of the following session.

## S1 - 2026-10-25
Did: repo root confirmed correct; .env untracked; empty .gitignore found and
     populated (4th instance of the silent-gate pattern, ADR-010); AWS account
     created via "Sign up for AWS (new)" Builder ID flow rather than a classic
     account. Builder ID MFA set, project spend limit $20, $120 credits.
Blocked: no root user, so no root MFA and no IAM-access-to-billing toggle.
     AWS-managed SCPs on the project account are invisible to me.
Decided: sign up again via "Sign up for AWS (advanced)" for a classic root plus
     IAM account. Accept losing the $120; real spend is a few dollars a month.
Next: create the classic AWS account (alternate email or +aws alias), root MFA,
      enable IAM access to billing, $5 budget with 80% actual and 100% forecast
      alerts, region us-east-1. Then install Terraform and the AWS CLI.
